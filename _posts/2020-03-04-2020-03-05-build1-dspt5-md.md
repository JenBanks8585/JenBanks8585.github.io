#From Saving the World to Learning Altair Visualizations

	Just like any student who aspires to learn well and create spectacular projects, I had great plans and aspirations for my first ever data science project. At the time of conception one of the hottest topics worldwide is the epidemic of covid19.  The rapid and abrupt increase in cases has not only affected China, South Korea and neighboring countries. It has also reached some countries in Europe, the Middle East and some states in the US such as California and Washington.

	Of course I ambitiously wanted to work with data on this topic but at the same time was quite overwhelmed with the enormousness of it all. It was going to be an eye popper and will help solve and contain the virus! I was going to see creative and unique correlations that no other well- experienced scientists nor analysts had seen nor realized. Yes just like in the movies!
